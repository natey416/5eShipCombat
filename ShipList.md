# Ship List

## Ship Stats

### Class

A ship's class, which can designate utility roles and size

### Speed

A ship's movement speed

### Crew

Crew is displayed with minimum and full values (IE Min/Full).

Staffing a ship with the minimum crew forces the ship to travel at half speed. When the full crew value is reached, the ship can travel at it's full rated speed.

### Payload

Payload is divided into persons and cargo. (IE People/Tons of cargo)
A ship can carry both it's capacity in people and it's capacity in cargo at the same time.

If a passenger is not part of the crew, it is added to the passenger payload. Any number of crew over the full crew value do not contribute to the ship's performance and are therefore added to the passenger value.

### Hit points and Armor Class

Different parts of the ship have various health points and associated AC.
