Each range band represents a circle on a radar graph. With the Playerâ€™s ship being in the center. The number, or score, next to the range band represents the speed required to enter the range band from an adjacent band.

* 1 Adjacent : within 120 ft. in this range we establish everything functions under normal initiative and combat rules. Most spells can be cast in this range. This is also the only range in which boarding can occur
* 2 Close: between 120 ft and 500 ft. This is the regular range of most cannons
* 3 Medium: between 500 ft and 1000ft. This is the long range of most cannons
* 4 Far: between 1000 ft and 1 mile.
* 5 Very Far: anything farther than a mile
